/// <summary>
/// Implements the <see cref="INotificationService"/> interface, providing methods to manage and retrieve notifications for users in the system. This class serves as a service layer that interacts with the notification repository to perform operations such as adding new notifications, retrieving notifications by user ID, and deleting notifications by their unique identifier. The service layer abstracts the underlying data access logic, allowing for separation of concerns and easier maintenance of the notification-related functionality in the application.

The repository is injected into the service, allowing for dependency inversion and enabling the service to interact with the data access layer for managing notifications. This constructor sets up the necessary dependencies for the service to function properly, ensuring that it can perform its operations related to notifications effectively.
